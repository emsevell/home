			George was thinking. He wasn’t much for thinking; none of the boys were. Master Walton wouldn’t like it. “That’s where the trouble is,” he would say, tapping his cane. “When you lot get to thinkin’, that’s where it is.” There was a lot Master Walton didn’t like, and when he found something he didn’t like, he would tap his cane. Some of the adults said he just liked the sound, but George knew better. His plump face held up his beady little eyes as he would look them over, pacing up and down. He was the sort you couldn’t get away with nothin’ around, and sometimes he would whack you one for just looking at him wrong. But George sometimes thought a bit anyways. He never did it when the others were around; they could always see it on his face. His little smudged face would scrunch up under his hat, no matter how hard he tried not to. Someone told on him once, one of the littler boys, and got him whooped at supper for it. George worked the boy over afterwards, made sure he wouldn’t tell on him again. Not too bad, but enough. He didn’t like it, but that’s what you had to do, sometimes. But today he was thinking about stars. It was one of the stories he’d heard from the adults, when they would talk over supper. The oldest of the men had the most to say. He was a farmer from before they marched everybody into the cities, and was about worn to the bone. Too thin for labor, too stiff to sew, too slow to cook. He knew his time on the job was about up, so he told stories when he could. And oh the stories he told! They were stories about war and loss, victory and adventure, places where the sky was blue as the stones he’d used to grind up for the paints. He said that the sky wasn’t always gray, back before the forges burned and the smoke curled. And that at night, back on the farm, you could see these things called stars, magnificent things that would spread all across the whole sky like spilled ink. When he was young, they came out every night, shining and winking down on him as he turned the fields as a boy. There were more than there were tubes in the great thinking machines, he would exclaim, holding his frail arms out in excitement. George had listened to all with rapt attention. He didn’t know that there could be more of anything than the tubes. He used to like stories like that, stories that took him to a new place, away from the iron and the concrete. But Max told, and Master Walton put a stop to that. “Fixin’ to put nasty ideas in the kids’ heads, are ye?” he’d roared, swinging this way and that with his cane. Maybe he thought that a good beating would knock the idea out of their heads. But George remembered. Now he was thinking about stars as he climbed up another set of iron stairs. He looked at the floor number; eighty-one, painted in red on the great iron pillar. He sighed. Just a few more to go. He’d never been up this high before; usually that was a job for the older kids, and he was only nine. More likely to come back, the task-master would say. But one of them had fallen down last week, and so they sent George. He plodded up another flight of stairs, panting at every step. His toolbox laid heavy against his back, its hard edges bouncing against his sweaty back at every step, catching on his suspenders and turning this way and that. He wiped the sweat away from his forehead with the back of one hand. It just smudged the soot and the grease worse. The air was hot. Even with the great fans blowing tepid air through the structure, the heat from the tubes grew worse with every step. George looked up again. Floor eighty-nine. This was it. He dropped the dented backpack heavily off of his shoulders, and it clanged against the metal grid of the walkway. George looked at his notepad and sighed. Thankfully the panel was on the outside of the floor. The inside was hotter than the furnaces at the iron works. The tubes faintly hummed as he wearily counted down to the proper panel. For each number he pointed at he let his arm fall back down as he slowly walked to the end. He didn’t know what they all were for; nobody did. He’d heard that it was a thinking machine, and that it was for the rich folks. He didn’t know what that meant, since they were just tubes, and tubes couldn’t think. But here they were, burning away night and day. You could see them at night glowing a deep orange through the haze. George inserted the crank and turned it round and round, sliding out the arm-length-thick panel before dragging his backpack over. The plug fit; he flipped the switch. Immediately it started buzzing as though there were a dozen wasps inside. As it worked, he looked out past the tower, into the air. He was high up enough to see all the way down to the park and up to the trainyards, though the smog and the falling night made him squint to make them out. George couldn’t tell if it made him feel big or small. He sat down at the edge and rubbed at his eyes. Already he had replaced four tubes today and was getting tired. The task-master only gave him water for three jobs and he was thirsty. Looking around, he thought some more, his little brow scrunching up, leaving lines in the soot. He didn’t know what the thinking machine did; didn’t know why it was built. He thought about that. If it was a machine that thought, did it know? Could he ask it? George could think, too, but he wasn’t a machine. He wasn’t built like this tower, with iron and glass and copper. But he didn’t know why he was built, either. Was there a reason? That idea startled George. It felt foreign, to ask what he was for. Master Walton always said he knew, with nobody asking. “You’re ‘ere to keep things going! It’s a noble thing, isn’t it?” But George didn’t think that was it. Maybe he was just the same like these tubes, just to work until he burnt out and they’d send someone to pluck him out, and put in a new one, just the same. The chiming of a little bell brought him out of his thoughts. He turned the backpack around to see its face - the light for section 12 was lit. He unplugged the worn cord, plugged it back in at the right section, and away it buzzed again. He sat heavily back down and coughed against the smog. He wondered about the older boy, the one who had fallen. George wondered if he fell in through the walkways, in the space between the tubes and the metal. He’d heard of one boy who died like that, and wished he hadn’t. The heat of the tubes had burnt him nearly black all over. The whole tower had smelled bad for a week. Or maybe he’d fallen outside, into the air. George peered over the edge, past his dangling legs and down to the narrow street below. He’d heard of men falling off the bigger towers, workers who’d stepped wrong; heard they screamed all the way down. George wondered why. They say it all happens at once, just a big rush then the end. Like falling into bed, almost. Just a little farther. A bed the task-master would never shout at you to get out of. The bell rang again. He leaned back to look at it, found the light for the tube. It was up in the corner, and was one of the big ones. He rummaged around in the back of the backpack and withdrew a fist-sized glass ampule full of delicate metal. It reflected a crude distortion of his face, as he turned it over and wiped it with his leather rag, and nothing but the grey sky beyond. He met his own tired eyes in the reflection. And then, just for a moment, there was a spark. George started, almost dropping the tube, then quickly leaned back in for a closer look. There it was again! Just the tiniest point of light in the dark gray. He jumped to his feet and spun around, rushing to the edge. He nearly flung himself off of the tower in excitement, instead grabbing one of the beams to lean out over the air. Shining down at him from between two smog-clouds, the tiniest point of light winked for a moment, then was gone. He strained his eyes until they hurt, not daring to blink, hoping for another glimpse. But it was gone. A star! George was sure of it. It was just like the old man had said. They weren’t gone, just hidden behind a heavy woolen blanket of smog and smoke. But he’d only seen one, up there beyond the clouds. Its friends were too shy, but that one had peeked out just enough to see the city. And George had seen it too. He called out to the hole in the sky that had been there for just a moment, hoping beyond hope for an answer, but none came. But they were there! He hadn’t realized it, but a wide grin had broken out over his face. The whole world was just hiding from them, just as he had when he was young, under his thin blanket when the monsters came in the night. Or maybe they were hidden from us, George thought. Maybe Master Walton or Master Elliott or Doctor Wright had blocked them out with their smoke and factories and iron works, so everybody would look at them instead. But now George knew, and he couldn’t wait to find more of them. He excitedly plucked out the burnt tube with his leather rag and pushed in the new one, not caring if it bounced against the others like Max had said not to. There was a star! They weren’t gone after all! And that one knew him now, it could see him on the tower, had even winked to him. The pain in his legs left him as he bounded back over to the crank, brought the panel back into the great machine. He didn’t know what its purpose was, but now he was sure of his. Nothing else mattered anymore as he bounded down the stairs, a smile stretching from ear to ear. He was going to pull back the blanket and bring something wonderful back to the sky, no matter how long it took.
