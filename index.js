Later, we were trying to get past some giants during a blizzard. They asked us who was there in Giant. Bum, the only one who could speak Giant since he was a giant barbarian, answered, of course, \"No one\". Things went downhill from there. Fortunately, his friend Thud was a bit more well-spoken."

A long time ago, I was an enjoyer of certain stories set in the Pokemon universe, chiefly one called \"Shifters and Shadows\" by What Lies Beyond. It's set in its own universe and introduces some interesting concepts. The premise of the story (and the others set in the same universe) is that there exist a class of so-called \"shifters\" within the Pokemon universe, who are capable of transforming into Pokemon. Some were natural, some were lab-created, some were \"awakened\", but all were hunted. The story meanders quite a bit, but so do the stories of the Pokemon games so that's kinda to be expected, and the prose is actually pretty good. It was a pretty neat read, and despite its lack of popularity (compared to some of the biggest stories, though it was received well) spawned several alternate stories in the same universe, even by other authors. I had considered writing one myself, and spent quite a while exchanging messages with the author, but I got busy with classes and other projects. Honestly what really happened is I discovered webcomics, but that's neither here nor there.\nIn any case, this is a drawing of Kitt, a Pikachu shifter and the main character of the main story, as well as her Pikachu form and a small Shinx named Anakin."

Off the top of my head, he was a lab-raised clone, and his Pokemon form is a mix of Jolteon and Vaporeon. He's able to take on forms between full human and full Pokemon."

He's had it pretty rough. Probably can be considered the most fleshed-out character in the story, when including the other side stories. It really has been a long time - I should probably give those a read again."
